Demand Theory (continued)

Elasticity

Demand elasticity: % Change of Quantity demanded given % Change of another factor

Own-Price Elasticity of Demand = %ΔQ/%ΔP = (ΔQ/Q)/(ΔP/P) = (P/Q)*(ΔQ/ΔP)

Excel practice

*Important: Elasticity is not constant along a linear demand, due to change of ratio of Quantity/Price, despite constant slope

< -1: Elastic
-1: Unitary
> -1: Inealstic

Point Elasticity: 
When the change is not marginal (ex. 1.5 to 2, change is 1/3), it goes against the very principle of elasticity

In the future, with real world date, be careful with the information you have

* Importance of derivatives: dQ/dP = beta_1 --> better estimate for elasticity
lim_(h->0) \frac{f(p+h)-f(p)}{h} --> estimates the marginal effect
