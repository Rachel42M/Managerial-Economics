Learning Objectives


How to develop a model
- what's your goal? clear questions, scope of your model
- hypothesis: educated guess/answer to your question
ex. limited demand, etc
- Next: how to use empirical studies and models to validate your hypothesis
- how it relates / explains historical data
- use model to prove your hypothesis - right OR wrong
- don't focus too much on significance - even if it's not significant, it's still something
- model is to show a result, either right OR wrong
  ex. supply turns out to be not limited
- wrong is NOT wrong
quantative analysis - to support decision making

Mini-case: Income threshold model
- only use income - car purchasing behavior
- neglected factors - important or not
- Occam's razor vs Blore's razor

*If historical data disagrees - the theory is WRONG
good model - clear and consistent with reality
if simple model makes clear prediction + realistis enough, great!
sophisticated model but wrong? Nah
