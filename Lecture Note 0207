CASE STUDY: Australia Iron Ore Industry
- hired many economists
- checked elasticity (around -0.2)
- why don't increase price?

Each Quarter: ~0.2 billion tons
At price $50/ton --> 10 billion
$150/ton --> 30 billion * twenty billion increase / quarter

After 2021, price decreased as demand in China decreased, back to ~$80/ton
China steel production --> iron ore prices
Price Demand drop --> due to irl change of demand, only focus on two variables here
When things not in the P/Q curve change, they change the whole situation

Elasticity 
- time frame is extremely important
- important to know WHY as well

-------------------

CASE STUDY: Philip Morris
1993 Cigarette price cut by 18%
Sale increases by 12.5%, Profits fell by 25%

Price elasticity of demand: % change of Q/ % change of P = 12.5/(-18) = -0.694
As this demand is inelastic, decreasing price will decrease firm revenue
