Homework Assignment: GitHub Setup and Introduction to Version Control
Due Feb 5 by 11:59pm Points 5 Submitting a text entry box or a website url

Objective:

This assignment aims to introduce you to the fundamentals of version control using GitHub and GitHub Desktop. You will

set up a GitHub account,
create a repository named "Managerial Economics,"
download GitHub Desktop, and
use it to upload a code or text file to your repository.
This task will help you understand how GitHub can be used for tracking changes and collaborating on projects.

Instructions:

Set Up Your GitHub Account:
If you haven't already, visit GitHub and sign up for a new account.
Complete the sign-up process and verify your email address as instructed.
 

Create a New Repository:
After logging in to GitHub, create a new repository, name your repository "ManagerialEconomics" and choose whether it will be public or private.
Initialize the repository with a README file by checking the appropriate box.
Upload a simple text file or a basic code file (e.g., .py for Python, .R for R).
 

Download and Install GitHub Desktop:
Go to the GitHub Desktop download page and download the version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to install GitHub Desktop on your computer.
Clone your repository using GitHub desktop:
Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub credentials.
Go to File > Clone Repository, find your "Managerial Economics" repository, and clone it to a local path on your computer.
Add some content to your file, such as a comment or a simple code snippet.
Edit your File Using GitHub Desktop:
Open GitHub Desktop; it should automatically detect the new file as an uncommitted change in your repository.
Add a summary of the change (e.g., "Added initial code file") and optionally a more detailed description.
Commit the change to your repository by clicking on Commit to main.
Push your commit to GitHub by clicking on Push origin to upload your changes to the online repository.
 

Submit the URL of your "Managerial Economics" GitHub repository via Canvas. Ensure the repository contains the new file you added.
 

Understanding Change Tracking:

GitHub tracks changes to files by taking snapshots of your repository at each commit. This allows you to:

View Changes: See what changes were made, who made them, and when.
Compare Versions: Look at differences between file versions to understand modifications.
Revert Changes: If needed, you can revert to previous versions of files or the entire project.
